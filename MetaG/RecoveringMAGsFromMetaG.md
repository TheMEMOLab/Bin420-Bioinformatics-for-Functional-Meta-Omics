# Recovering MAGs from Metagenomic data



1. Quality control of raw reads.

## Running Chopper:

```bash
cd /cluster/projects/nn9987k
mkdir $USER
cd $USER
mkdir scripts && mkdir data && mkdir -p results/MetaG
tree
```

This should be the structure of the directory:

```
.
├── data
├── results
│   └── MetaG
└── scripts

4 directories, 0 files

```
